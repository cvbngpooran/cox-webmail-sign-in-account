 A lot of people like to check their email using apps like Microsoft Outlook, Apple Mail, or Gmail.  You can use IMAP or POP3 to connect Cox Webmail to other services.  The incoming and outgoing mail server settings in your Cox account help section will help you set up your email in a third-party app.

 Using these kinds of integrations makes it easier to talk to people and lets you handle more than one email account in one place.

 Taking care of email settings and preferences
 After you sign in, look through your Cox Webmail options to make your email experience your own.  You can make email signatures, set up automatic answers, change spam filters, and make rules for how to handle incoming messages.

 You may also change how often your inbox refreshes, how you want to be notified, and how things seem.  These settings help make things run more smoothly and provide you a more personalized experience, which boosts productivity.

 Good administration of settings helps with better organization and faster communication.

 How to Log Out of Cox Webmail Safely
 It's important to log out of your email account after you're done, especially if you're using a shared or public computer.  The logout button is normally in the top right corner of the dashboard.

 Clicking this will end your session and take you to the Cox homepage.  Before closing the browser tab, always check to see if you are logged out.

 This habit makes your account safer and keeps your messages and data private.

 How to Keep Your Inbox Healthy
 An inbox that is structured makes it easier to find essential messages and get more done.  Delete or archive old emails on a regular basis, unsubscribe from newsletters you don't read anymore, and use folders or labels to organize your messages.

 Turn on spam filtering to keep your inbox clean and free of harmful content.  To keep things in order, set rules that automatically sort incoming messages by sender or subject.
